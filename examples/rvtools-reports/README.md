# Generate reports from RVTools

RVtools is a popular tool used in virtual environments to gather detailed information about vSphere configurations. It exports data in CSV format, making it easy to process and analyze.

* The CSV files generated by RVtools contain information such as:
* Virtual Machine Details: Names, configurations, resource usage, and operational states.
* Datastores: Storage details, usage statistics, and capacity.
* Networks: Virtual switches, port groups, and connected devices.
* Clusters and Hosts: CPU and memory utilization, host uptime, and cluster configurations.

By using this data, participants can create pipelines that:

* Summarize key statistics about the virtual environment.
* Identify potential issues, such as over-provisioned resources or underutilized datastores.
* Generate automated reports for IT administrators to make informed decisions about infrastructure optimization.
