# Welcome to the Docling Hackathon 🐤🐤: Building Document Processing Pipelines on Red Hat OpenShift AI 🚀 

Welcome to an exciting hackathon where innovation meets cutting-edge technology! 🌟 This event challenges you to harness the power of Docling, the open-source document processing tool, and integrate it with Red Hat OpenShift AI to build intelligent and efficient document processing pipelines. Your mission is to create solutions that transform unstructured document data into actionable insights, leveraging the capabilities of generative AI. 💡

## Why Docling and OpenShift AI?

Organizations today face a massive challenge: extracting meaningful insights from vast amounts of unstructured data trapped in formats like PDFs, DOCX, and PPTX. 📄 Docling, developed by IBM Research and now open source, addresses this challenge by converting complex documents into structured formats (e.g., Markdown or JSON) while preserving context and structure. By combining Docling with Red Hat OpenShift AI’s robust hybrid cloud platform ☁️, participants can build scalable, enterprise-ready pipelines for:
* Fine-tuning generative AI models 🤖.
* Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows 📚.
* Context-aware question-answering systems ❓.

This hackathon is your opportunity to explore these technologies and create impactful solutions for real-world problems. 🌍

## Key Technologies

* **Docling**: An open-source tool for advanced document parsing and conversion.
  * Supports formats like PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, and HTML 📑.
  * Integrates with tools like LlamaIndex and LangChain for RAG tasks 🦙.
  * Preserves context in complex layouts (e.g., multi-column text or tables spanning pages) 📊.
* **Red Hat OpenShift AI**: A hybrid cloud platform optimized for deploying generative AI workloads 🌐.
    * Helps you in all levels of MLops: develop, train, productize, and serve ⚡.
    * Combines IBM’s Granite LLMs with Red Hat’s InstructLab tools 🛠️.
    * Enables fine-tuning and deployment of custom models across cloud environments 🚉.
