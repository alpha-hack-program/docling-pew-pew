# Welcome to the Docling Hackathon 🐤🐤: Building Document Processing Pipelines on Red Hat OpenShift AI 🚀 

Welcome to an exciting hackathon where innovation meets cutting-edge technology! 🌟 This event challenges you to harness the power of Docling, the open-source document processing tool, and integrate it with Red Hat OpenShift AI to build intelligent and efficient document processing pipelines. Your mission is to create solutions that transform unstructured document data into actionable insights, leveraging the capabilities of generative AI. 💡

## Why Docling and OpenShift AI?

Organizations today face a massive challenge: extracting meaningful insights from vast amounts of unstructured data trapped in formats like PDFs, DOCX, and PPTX. 📄 Docling, developed by IBM Research and now open source, addresses this challenge by converting complex documents into structured formats (e.g., Markdown or JSON) while preserving context and structure. By combining Docling with Red Hat OpenShift AI’s robust hybrid cloud platform ☁️, participants can build scalable, enterprise-ready pipelines for:
* Fine-tuning generative AI models 🤖.
* Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows 📚.
* Context-aware question-answering systems ❓.

This hackathon is your opportunity to explore these technologies and create impactful solutions for real-world problems. 🌍


## Who Should Participate?

This hackathon is open to developers, data scientists, AI enthusiasts 🤓, and anyone passionate about solving document processing challenges using generative AI. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or a newcomer to the field, this event is designed to foster creativity and collaboration 🤝.
