      "\n",
      "Red Hat OpenShift AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform that provides tools to rapidly train, serve, and monitor machine learning (ML) models onsite, in the public cloud, or at the edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenShift AI provides a powerful AI/ML platform for building AI-enabled applications. Data scientists and MLOps engineers can collaborate to move from experiment to production in a consistent environment quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can deploy OpenShift AI on any supported version of OpenShift, whether on-premise, in the cloud, or in disconnected environments. For details on supported versions, see Red Hat OpenShift AI: Supported Configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1.1. DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW\n",
      "\n",
      "For the purpose of getting you started with OpenShift AI, Figure 1 illustrates a simplified data science workflow. The real world process of developing ML models is an iterative one.\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplified data science workflow for predictive AI use cases includes the following tasks:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Defining your business problem and setting goals to solve it.\n",
      "- Gathering, cleaning, and preparing data. Data often has to be federated from a range of sources, and exploring and understanding data plays a key role in the success of a data science project.\n",
      "- Evaluating and selecting ML models for your business use case.\n",
      "- Train models for your business use case by tuning model parameters based on your set of training data. In practice, data scientists train a range of models, and compare performance while considering tradeoffs such as time and memory constraints.\n",
      "- Integrate models into an application, including deployment and testing. After model training, the next step of the workflow is production. Data scientists are often responsible for putting the model in production and making it accessible so that a developer can integrate the model into an application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monitor and manage deployed models. Depending on the organization, data scientists, data\n",
      "\n",
      "- Monitor and manage deployed models. Depending on the organization, data scientists, data engineers, or ML engineers must monitor the performance of models in production, tracking prediction and performance metrics.\n",
      "- Refine and retrain models. Data scientists can evaluate model performance results and refine models to improve outcome by excluding or including features, changing the training data, and modifying other configuration parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1.2. ABOUT THIS GUIDE\n",
      "\n",
      "This guide assumes you are familiar with data science and ML Ops concepts. It describes the following tasks to get you started with using OpenShift AI:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Log in to the OpenShift AI dashboard\n",
      "- Create a data science project\n",
      "- If you have data stored in Object Storage, configure a connection to more easily access it\n",

      "## CHAPTER 2. LOGGING IN TO OPENSHIFT AI\n",
      "\n",
      "After you install OpenShift AI, log in to the OpenShift AI dashboard so that you can set up your development and deployment environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prerequisites\n",
      "\n",
      "- You know the OpenShift AI identity provider and your login credentials.\n",
      "- If you are a data scientist, data engineer, or ML engineer, your administrator must provide you with the OpenShift AI instance URL, for example:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## Verification\n",
      "\n",
      "- The OpenShift AI dashboard opens on the Home page.\n",
      "\n",
      "## CHAPTER 3. CREATING A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT\n",
      "\n",
      "To implement a data science workflow, you must create a project. In OpenShift, a project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, and is the main way that you can manage user access to resources. A project organizes your data science work in one place and also allows you to collaborate with other developers and data scientists in your organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a project, you can add the following functionality:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Connections so that you can access data without having to hardcode information like endpoints or credentials.\n",
      "- Workbenches for working with and processing data, and for developing models.\n",
      "- Deployed models so that you can test them and then integrate them into intelligent applications. Deploying a model makes it available as a service that you can access by using an API.\n",
      "- Pipelines for automating your ML workflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prerequisites\n",
      "\n",
      "- You have logged in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n",
      "- If you are using OpenShift AI groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, rhoai-users or rhoai-admins ) in OpenShift.\n",
      "- You have the appropriate roles and permissions to create projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Procedure\n",
      "\n",
      "- 1. From the OpenShift AI dashboard, select Data Science Projects . The Data Science Projects page shows a list of projects that you can access. For each userrequested project in the list, the Name column shows the project display name, the user who requested the project, and the project description.\n",
      "- 2.  Click Create project .\n",
      "- 3.  In the Create project dialog, update the Name field to enter a unique display name for your project.\n",
      "- 4.  Optional: If you want to change the default resource name for your project, click Edit resource name .\n",
      "- The resource name is what your resource is labeled in OpenShift. Valid characters include lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (-). The resource name cannot exceed 30 characters, and it must start with a letter and end with a letter or number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: You cannot change the resource name after the project is created. You can edit only the display name and the description.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 5.  Optional: In the Description field, provide a project description.\n",
      "- 6.  Click Create .\n",
      "\n",
      "## Verification\n",
      "\n",
      "- A project details page opens. From this page, you can add connections, create workbenches, configure pipelines, and deploy models.\n",
      "\n",
      "## CHAPTER 4. CREATING A WORKBENCH AND SELECTING AN IDE\n",
      "\n",
      "A workbench is an isolated area where you can examine and work with ML models. You can also work with data and run programs, for example to prepare and clean data. While a workbench is not required if, for example, you only want to service an existing model, one is needed for most data science workflow tasks, such as writing code to process data or training a model.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you create a workbench, you specify an image (an IDE, packages, and other dependencies). Supported IDEs include JupyterLab, code-server, and RStudio (Technology Preview).\n",
      "\n",
      "The IDEs are based on a server-client architecture. Each IDE provides a server that runs in a container on the OpenShift cluster, while the user interface (the client) is displayed in your web browser. For example, the Jupyter notebook server runs in a container on the Red Hat OpenShift cluster. The client is the JupyterLab interface that opens in your web browser on your local computer. All of the commands that you enter in JupyterLab are executed by the notebook server. Similarly, other IDEs like code-server or RStudio Server provide a server that runs in a container on the OpenShift cluster, while the user interface is displayed in your web browser. This architecture allows you to interact through your local computer in a browser environment, while all processing occurs on the cluster. The cluster provides the benefits of larger available resources and security because the data being processed never leaves the cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a workbench, you can also configure connections (to access external data for training models and to save models so that you can deploy them) and cluster storage (for persisting data). Workbenches within the same project can share models and data through object storage with the data science pipelines and model servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "For data science projects that require data retention, you can add container storage to the workbench you are creating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a project, you can create multiple workbenches. When to create a new workbench depends on considerations, such as the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The workbench configuration (for example, CPU, RAM, or IDE). If you want to avoid editing the configuration of an existing workbench's configuration to accommodate a new task, you can create a new workbench instead.\n",
      "- Separation of tasks or activities. For example, you might want to use one workbench for your Large Language Models (LLM) experimentation activities, another workbench dedicated to a demo, and another workbench for testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.1. ABOUT WORKBENCH IMAGES\n",
      "\n",
      "A workbench image (sometimes referred to as a notebook image) is optimized with the tools and libraries that you need for model development. You can use the provided workbench images or an OpenShift AI administrator can create custom workbench images adapted to your needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide a consistent, stable platform for your model development, many provided workbench images contain the same version of Python. Most workbench images available on OpenShift AI are pre-built and ready for you to use immediately after OpenShift AI is installed or upgraded.\n",
      "\n",
      "For information about Red Hat support of workbench images and packages, see Red Hat OpenShift AI: Supported Configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following table lists the workbench images that are installed with Red Hat OpenShift AI by default.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the preinstalled packages that are provided in these images are not sufficient for your use case, you have the following options:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Install additional libraries after launching a default image. This option is good if you want to add libraries on an ad hoc basis as you develop models. However, it can be challenging to manage the dependencies of installed libraries and your changes are not saved when the workbench restarts.\n",
      "- Create a custom image that includes the additional libraries or packages. For more information, see Creating custom workbench images.\n",
