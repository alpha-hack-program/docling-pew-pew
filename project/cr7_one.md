# Cristiano Ronaldo

**Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro** GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]
ⓘ; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for

and captains both the Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely
regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won numerous individual
accolades throughout his career, such as five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's
Player of the Year Awards, four European Golden Shoes, and was named five times the world's
best player by FIFA,[note 3] the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career,
including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European
Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances
(183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, most appearances (30), assists (8),
goals in the European Championship (14), international appearances (217) and international
goals (135). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career
appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 900 official senior career goals
for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.[note 4]

Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in
2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He went on to win three consecutive Premier
League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first
Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer
when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He
became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale
which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including
_La Décima_. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014 , and again
in 2016 and 2017 , and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career
rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the
Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons
between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles,
two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for
Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for
an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa
Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player, and the
first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to
Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his
contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.

Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has earned more
than 200 caps, making him history's most-capped male player.[^8 ] With 130 international goals,
he is also the all-time top male goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in eleven major tournaments and
scored in ten; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach
the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named
the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year,
he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as
the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement saw him receive his fourth
Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019,
receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of
Euro 2020. The same tournament, he broke the record of most international goals scored in
men's football and became the player with the most international caps in men's football in 2023.

One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's
highest-paid athlete by _Forbes_ in 2016, 2017, 2023, and 2024 and the world's most famous
athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. _Time_ included him on their list of the 100 most influential
people in the world in 2014. Ronaldo is the most popular sportsperson on social media: he
counts over 1 billion total followers across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, making
him the first person to achieve that feat. In 2020, Ronaldo was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream
Team and he is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of
Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of
Santo António.[^9 ][^10 ] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros
Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman,[^11 ][^12 ] and José
Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the _Junta de Freguesia_ of Santo António and part-time kit
man for football club Andorinha.[^13 ][^14 ][^15 ] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da
Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese
Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16.[^16 ][^17 ] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two
older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Kátia".[^2 ] He was named after actor and U.S. President
Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[^18 ] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort
him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor
refused to perform the procedure.[^19 ][^20 ] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home,
sharing a room with all his siblings.[^21 ]

As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[^22 ] where his father was the kit
man,[^13 ] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of
£1,500.[^23 ] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system.[^23 ] By age 14, while struggling with his school
duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-
professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes,[^24 ] to cease his education to focus entirely on
football.[^25 ][^26 ] With a troubled life as a student,[^27 ] and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family,[^28 ][^29 ] he did not complete
schooling beyond the 6th grade.[^30 ][^31 ] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who
he said had "disrespected" him.[^25 ] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing
football.[^32 ] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart
rate.[^33 ] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[^34 ] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's
mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he
hadn't become a professional football player.[^35 ]

Growing up, Ronaldo idolised the Brazilian footballers Ronaldinho and Ronaldo Nazário, and has described them as leaving "a beautiful history in
football".[^36 ]

After impressing in Sporting's youth teams, he was promoted to the main team by first-team manager László Bölöni. At age 17, on 14 August 2002,
he played his first official match for the first team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter
Milan,[^37 ] and his Primeira Liga debut, took place a month later against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their
3–0 win.[^38 ] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona
president Joan Laporta.[^39 ] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to
discuss a possible transfer.[^40 ]

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–
at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for
a year.[^41 ] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson said Ronaldo was "one of the
most exciting young players" he had ever seen.[^41 ][^42 ]

```
On 12 August 2003, less than a week after the friendly that impressed Ferguson, Manchester United
signed Ronaldo for £12 million,[^44 ] an England record for a teenager.[^45 ] This also made him the
first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[^46 ]
```
```
Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7
shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and
David Beckham.[^47 ] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[^48 ] A
key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he
later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my
career."[^49 ]
